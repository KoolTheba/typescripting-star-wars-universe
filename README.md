This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
This is the Typescript version of my original [Star Wars Universe](https://github.com/KoolTheba/star-wars-universe). ðŸš¨ If you want a project for practicing your Typescript skills, just clone the code and add some cool types to it! ðŸš€ Then, I recommend to use `@typescript-eslint` for checking your possible errors or spare any that wonders around.

## Scripts
### Project up and running
Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Project formatted and passing eslint rules
I've added prettier and eslint to the project. I can currently assure that âœ… this project is 100% free of eslint warning or errors.

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

## Further development
- I'll be adding the e2e tests with Cypress
- And for a next iteration: I'll refactor the project with React Query

## Other Typescript repos
You can also check my other Typescript repos collection and test your TS skills with another cool React project I did few months ago, pretty cool and interesting for practicing more React with TS:
- [Typescript basics and resources](https://github.com/KoolTheba/typescript-project-alfa)
- [Typescript with React with exercises](https://github.com/KoolTheba/typescript-project-alfa)
